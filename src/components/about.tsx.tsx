            I&apos;ve always been passionate about technology, studying and
            creating projects daily to become an excellent Software Engineer.
            Currently, my focus is on Front-end development. Leveraging my
            background as a photographer and designer, I delight in crafting
            visually stunning user interfaces.
            <br />
            <br /> I&apos;m already capable of developing a complete project,
            both on the frontend using React, React Native, Next, Typescript and
            CSS as Tailwind CSS, and on the backend using Node.js, Prisma, and
            CMS like Hygraph and Strapi. I have advanced English skills,
            acquired during the three years I lived in the United States and
            also through studies at the University of Georgia.
            <br />
            <br /> Additionally, I have a rich experience of over 20 years in
            artwork photography, having worked in major agencies in SÃ£o Paulo. I
            believe my ability to transform an offline project (graphic layout
            in Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop) into a web app/site is a unique
            combination of technical and creative skills.
